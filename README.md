# Discover-Weekly-Sort
Sort my Discover Weekly playlist by similarity to one of my playlists

This python file is set up to run every Monday at noon. It takes my Discover Weekly playlist for the week and runs cosine similarity on the songs to a playlist of my choice - currently "country." It then saves a new playlist for me with the sorted results based on similarity. This way, if I can only listen to some of the songs, my Discover Weekly playlist should be ordered from most likely that I will enjoy it to least.
